                                    Taiwan is an island nation surrounded by the sea and crowned with high mountains. To the east lies the Pacific Ocean, where the Kuroshio Current flows northward year-round, bringing warm waters and abundant marine life. To the west lies the Taiwan Strait, a vital corridor for global shipping. Across the island runs the Central Mountain Range, stretching from north to south, with peaks such as Yangmingshan, Syue Mountain, Alishan, and Dawu Mountain, each shaped by its own climate and landscape. Nestled among these mountains is the dazzling Sun Moon Lake, the largest lake in central Taiwan and a popular attraction for locals and tourists alike.

                                    For creators in Taiwan, mountains, seas, ocean currents, and lakes are not just natural scenery but part of everyday life. Many picture books and children’s novels draw their inspiration from these landscapes. Reflecting on our connection to nature, this issue of our newsletter introduces picture books and children’s literature inspired by mountains and the sea. 
                                </p>

                                    These picture books invite readers to reconsider the world we live in. Through shared reading, they offer a space for dialogue; in the process, children may reveal perspectives and insights even more valuable than our own.

                                    In <em>Tongku Saveq: Tiang, Child of the Mountain</em>, readers follow a Bunun family, one of Taiwan’s Indigenous peoples, on a journey across Jade Mountain. This picture book portrays the mountain, known to the Bunun since ancient times as Tongku Saveq, through the eyes of three generations: a grandfather, a father, and the young boy Tiang. Rather than treating the summit as something to conquer, they understand the mountain as part of the world’s living rhythms.

                                    Similarly, in <em>The Sea Turtle and the Sea</em>, a young turtle sets off across the deep blue ocean. Along the way, the turtle encounters vibrant coral reefs and lush seagrass meadows, but also discovers waters choked with waste and damaged by pollution. This book helps children understand how everyday human actions affect marine life, and how the future of the sea depends on the choices we make.

                                    <em>My Mana! Coming of Age Ceremony in the Mountains and Forests</em> follows a fifth-grade boy who embarks on a secret camping trip with his classmates. The son of a forest ranger, he is determined to prove to his dad that he’s capable of camping on his own. But the children encounter many dangers: they are attacked by bees, forced to seek shelter during a torrential downpour, and even chased by wild boars. In this book, these children learn to understand their own limits, care for one another, identify plants, and recognize intricate ecosystems.

                                    Finally, in <em>The Girl Called the Lake Goddess</em>, a mysterious girl arrives at a small guesthouse by Lake Seryue. Claiming to be the spirit of the lake, she warns that the water has been polluted and that the lake is in danger. At first, no one believes her. But children who befriend her gradually uncover a dangerous secret behind the source of the pollution. Even more troubling, many of the children’s parents are involved in the scheme. Will the children stand up for the lake’s future and the protection of nature, or will they follow in their parents’ footsteps?

                                    These stories follow children through forests and across coastlines. Together, they invite us to listen to the voices of nature and cherish the environment around us.

                                    Across the world, indigenous peoples possess their own distinctive history, worldview, and ecology. In this award-winning book, readers follow Taiwan’s Bunun people as they journey to Taiwan’s highest mountain, Mount Jade, which they have called “Tongku Saveq” since ancient times.

                                    In this gorgeously illustrated book, three generations of Bunun people—grandfather, father, and the child Tiang—embark on a thrilling journey. They ascend in harmony with the mountains, listen to the trees sing, and watch the cypress, pine, hemlock, fir, and juniper race one another. Tiang begins to grasp how intimately his father, an alpine porter who hauls logs up and down the mountains, understands their surroundings. Together, this multigenerational family contemplates the relationship between humanity and all living things.

                                    In <em>The Sea Turtle and the Sea</em>, a young sea turtle explores the deep ocean, driven by a simple yet profound question: Is the world on the other side of the sea as beautiful? Along the way, the turtle encounters dazzling wonders—but also waters polluted by human waste and destruction. Soon, it is injured by debris, including plastic and fishing nets, and is ultimately rescued by ocean conservationists.

                                    Told with warmth and visual richness, the story introduces young readers to the marvels of the underwater world while quietly awakening concern for its fragility. Through the turtle’s curiosity, fear, injury, and eventual rescue, the book invites children and adults alike to empathize with ocean life and to understand that caring for the sea is an urgent and essential responsibility we all share.

                                    In <em>My Mana! Coming of Age Ceremony in the Mountains and Forests</em>, Pin-Hung, the son of a forest ranger, longs to prove that he is no longer a child. Even though he is still deeply attached to his “mana,” a small blanket that has comforted him since infancy, he secretly leads his classmates on a camping trip into the mountains on the eve of graduating from elementary school. Hoping to demonstrate his courage and independence by facing the wilderness on their own, the children quickly find themselves in the midst of suspense and challenges: they are attacked by bees, forced to take shelter during a torrential downpour, and even chased by wild boars.

                                    Through encounters with small plants like dodder, baby bats nurtured by their mother, and a young boar caught in a snare, Pin-Hung comes to realize that he, too, is still growing. Blending ecological knowledge with emotional insight, this book shows how children learn responsibility, empathy, and self-trust through close contact with the natural world.

                                    What if the wishes you thought were safely hidden at the bottom of a lake were suddenly brought to light? In <em>The Girl Called the Lake Goddess</em>, an enigmatic thirteen-year-old who claims to be the spirit of Lake Seryue, arrives at a family guesthouse, dragging a suitcase of muddy, moss-covered coins and warning that the lake has been polluted. No one believes her at first. But when drought strikes and the water recedes, layers of silt and countless wish stones—stones that people have been throwing into the lake—begin to surface. These long-buried secrets spark a chain of unsettling mysteries.

                                    Blending magical realism with an ecological and moral inquiry inspired by Taiwan’s Sun Moon Lake, the novel explores belief, responsibility, and the cost of ignoring the natural world. Children of the lakeside community confront hidden crimes and the consequences of human desire. This book invites young readers to listen to the voice of the lake itself, reflecting on how protecting nature also means facing truths that have long been submerged.
